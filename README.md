# Orca screen reader (laptop layout) one-page reference
[Orca](https://orca.gnome.org) is screen reader software made by GNOME that ships with several Linux distributions, such as Fedora, Ubuntu, and OpenSUSE. 

This document aims to be a one-page reference sheet of keyboard commands for Orca. It's a work in progress that may be improved by removing little-used commands and adding missing commands. 

This document is not produced by, endorsed by, or in any other way associated with GNOME, the maintainers of Orca.
